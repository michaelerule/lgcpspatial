### Abstract

We present practical solutions to applying Gaussian-process methods to calculate spatial statistics for grid cells in large environments. Gaussian processes are a data efficient approach to inferring neural tuning as a function of time, space, and other variables. We discuss how to design appropriate kernels for grid cells, and show that a variational Bayesian approach to log-Gaussian Poisson models can be calculated quickly. This class of models has closed-form expressions for the evidence lower-bound, and can be estimated rapidly for certain parameterizations of the posterior covariance. We provide an implementation that operates in a low-rank spatial frequency subspace for further acceleration. We demonstrate these methods on a recording from grid cells in a large environment.

### Repository structure

This repository contains example implementations of log-Gaussian Cox process regressions for analyzing grid cells (and perhaps other periodic, densely sampled 2D spatial datasets).
