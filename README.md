# lgcpspatial

Log-Gaussian Cox process Python library designed for analyzing grid cells (and perhaps other periodic, densely sampled 2D spatial datasets).
[Please see the documentation on Github pages.](https://michaelerule.github.io/lgcpspatial/index.html)



If you're brave enough to test it, please get in touch. I need feedback on
 
 - Does this actually work outside of the datasets its been tested on?
 - Does this actually perform well on other hardware configuration?
 - How hard is it to start using? Is it missing dependencies? 
 - Are there simple ways to improve the API? 

There will be bugs and issues; Let's work them out before this thing goes to peer review. I don't have much time these days, but will be able to make a few more passes to tidy things up before we reach a "version of record".
